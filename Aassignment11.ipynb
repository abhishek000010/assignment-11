    "Q1 -> Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -> n most programming languages, including Python, the function used to open a file is typically called open().\n",
    "\n",
    "The open() function in Python takes two arguments: the path to the file you want to open, and the mode in which you want to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the different modes in which you can open a file in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' -> (read mode): This is the default mode in which a file is opened if no mode is specified. In this mode, you can only read the contents of the file. You cannot modify or write to the file. If the file does not exist, an error will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (write mode): In this mode, you can write to the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (append mode): In this mode, you can append new content to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file and open it for writing only if the file does not already exist. If the file already exists, an error will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (binary mode): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode, which is necessary when working with non-text files like images, audio, and video.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' (text mode): This mode is used to open a file in text mode, which is the default mode. Text mode is used when working with text files, like .txt or .csv files.\n",
    "\n",
    "'+' (read and write mode): This mode is used to open a file for both reading and writing. You can add this mode to any of the above modes to enable both reading and writing.\n",

    "Q2 ->  Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -> The close() function is used to close an open file in Python. It is important to close a file after you have finished working with it, as it releases the system resources that were allocated to the file when it was opened. If you do not close the file, it can lead to memory leaks and other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file also ensures that any changes you made to the file are saved. When you open a file in write mode, for example, the changes you make to the file are not saved until you close the file. If you do not close the file, the changes may not be saved and the file may be incomplete or corrupted.\n",

    "read(), readline(), and readlines() are methods in Python used for reading files. Here's an explanation of each method, along with some sample Python code.\n",

    "Q5 -> Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and\n",
    "open() together?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -> The with statement in Python is a context manager that simplifies the process of managing resources and ensures that resources are properly released when the code block is exited, even in the case of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open() function is used to open files and create a file object. When a file is opened using open(), it needs to be closed explicitly to release the resources. If the file is not closed, it can lead to resource leaks and other issues.\n",
